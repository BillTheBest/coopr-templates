# Coopr Templates

This repository contains the default set of templates used by [Coopr](http://coopr.io) by Cask and some helper scripts to work with the templates.

## Templates
Templates fall into one of two categories, templates which define hardware, and templates which define software.

### Hardware
- providers - set of credentials and variables used to connect to provider APIs
- hardwaretypes - abstraction of hardware to provider-specific instance types
- imagetypes - abstraction of image to provider-specific images

### Software
- services - defines how to operate (install, configure, start, stop, etc) a piece of software
- clustertemplates - collection of software, rules, and configuration to define a cluster
